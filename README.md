The complete Unity3D open source to a 'brick breaker' clone game by Terry Paton.

This game was developed as a rapid prototype using hand drawn art as a placeholders. The major gimmick to the game, aside from the powers are the 'bosses', essentially large bricks that need multiple hits.

Available to play in the Android google play store: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.terrypaton.cinder"> Cinder </a>

## How to I open it?
Using Unity 2019.4+ open the project in the folder, 'Cinder'. Press play. The game is setup that it requires the scene 'Loading' to be run first. There is a tool for navigating to the games scenes. You can find this under the menu Cinder > Cinder Window

# Why?
The primary focus is as a portfolio piece.  It was developed as a rapid prototype in 2016 partly to demonstrate how rapidlyI can make a game. Now updated (in late 2020) to the some of the new standards Terry has learnt since it was originally written.
Often my paid work is NDA and I can't show anything when looking for new opportunities. So its a little sampling of what I can do, squeezed in after work and between life.
